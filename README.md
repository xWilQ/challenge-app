This web app was created in about a week for a weekend cottage trip with friends. 
The idea was to add some fun to our time together by playing a challenge game where participants take on random challenges.

How it works:
- User opens up the webpage and inputs their username, after that they recieve 5 random challenges out of our challenge pool.
- Players can skip challenges and will recieve a new challenge instead. Firebase firestore is used to store userdata and the challenges.
- Players can submit proof of a completed challenge by adding an image or a comment when submitting.
- An easy-to-use interface with support for skipping and submitting challenges.

**Currently working on version 2**

Version 2 will introduce an admin dashboard, giving game creators full control over their challenge games. This dashboard will allow creators to:
- Configure settings and rules for each game.
- Create custom challenges tailored to their group.
- Select or modify "challenge packs" to suit the mood or theme of the event.
