This web app was created in about a week for a weekend cottage trip with friends. 
The idea was to add some fun to our time together by playing a challenge game where participants take on random challenges.

How it works:
User opens up the webpage and inputs their username, after that they recieve 5 random challenges out of our challenge pool.
Players can skip challenges and will recieve a new challenge instead. Firebase firestore is used to store userdata and the challenges.
Players can submit proof of a completed challenge by adding an image or a comment when submitting.
An easy-to-use interface with support for skipping and submitting challenges.
