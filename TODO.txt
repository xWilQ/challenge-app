TODO:
- Make it "endless", users should get a new challenge on skip and on a completed challenge?
- Decide if players should be rewarded with additional skips after completing a number of challenges.
- Fix colors.

- FIXING UNIQUENESS THING BY HAVING MULTIPLES OF SAME QUESTION IN THE DATABASE
 + AutoID by firebase, same name on challenge so check that before adding to player.


KOODI MIETTEITÃ„

use UNIQUENESS

but not running ID but AutoID instead.

User grabs all challenges picks out 5 and adds those to the users database and locally, 
then lowers the UNIQUENESS value on those 5 challenges. 

When a user skips or completes a challenge one new challenge should be added but to get a random one,
again need to get all the challenges and just pick one by random check it's UNIQUENESS value make sure it's > 0.
add it to the user locally and users database, and then write and lower it's UNIQUENESS value by 1.

A player can complete a maximum of 15 challenges. 

DONT POST ANY CODE YET! Is this hard to implement, does it sound good? what would you change? Are there possibilities for collisions. And Calculate how many challenges will i need, if all of them have a UNIQUENESS of 3
